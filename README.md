**Image classification is one of the fundamental problems in the field of computer vision and deep learning. This project aims to develop a robust image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow, one of the most widely used deep learning frameworks. The purpose of this task is to train a neural network model that can recognize and classify images into predefined categories with a high degree of accuracy.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model specifically designed to process and analyze visual data. Unlike traditional neural networks, CNNs use convolutional layers that scan the image in small parts (filters/kernels), learning features like edges, shapes, textures, and patterns. These features help the model distinguish between different classes of images.
In this project, the CIFAR-10 dataset is used for model training and testing. CIFAR-10 is a standard benchmark dataset consisting of 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels), categorized into 10 different classes, such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, which provides a good balance for training and evaluating the model’s performance.
This project demonstrates the power of CNNs in solving real-world problems like image recognition. It provides a solid foundation for working with more complex datasets or real-time applications such as face recognition, medical imaging, self-driving cars, and object detection. The project also introduces students to TensorFlow’s capabilities and prepares them for more advanced deep learning tasks by teaching them how to preprocess data, build neural networks, train models, evaluate results, and optimize performance.**
